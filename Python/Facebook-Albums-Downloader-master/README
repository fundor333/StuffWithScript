   I WANT TO DOWNLOAD MY FRIENDS PHOTO
   To download your friend photos you have to edit the 'id_user' variable:
       id_user = "YOUR_FRIEND_USERNAME OR UID"
    
   You can get your friend UID by editing and then opening this link:
       https://www.graph.facebook.com/YOUR_FRIEND_NICKNAME_HERE
   Will appear something like that:

    {
	   "name": "Facebook Platform",
	   "website": "http://developers.facebook.com",
	   "username": "platform",
	   "founded": "May 2007",
	   "company_overview": "Facebook Platform...",
	   "mission": "To make the web more open and social.",
	   "products": "Facebook Application Prog...",
	   "likes": 449921,
	   "id": 19292868552,
	   "category": "Technology"
   }

   You have to copy the "id" value, in this example it's "19292868552" 
   and paste it into the script like that:
       id_user = "19292868552"

   you can now run the script by using:
       python download_photos.py
