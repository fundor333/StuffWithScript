# MasterWebpageMailer is designed to email the contents of your web page (the 
# portions you specify) to your visitor or visitor's associate.
#
# It is designed to be executed with Perl 5; it won't work with versions prior to 5.
# It was developed and tested on a Unix server.

#===============================

MasterWebpageMailer is designed to be easily maintainable.

You need four files:
  		(1) This README file
		(2) The MasterWebpageMailer.cgi file
		(3) The globals.cgi file
		(4) The web page which contains your "email this page" form

Only one thing needs to be verified correct in the program code, MasterWebpageMailer.cgi: 
		(1) the location of Perl 5 on your system
	Once that is done, it is ready to upload.

Only two things needs to be verified correct in the global variables file, globals.cgi: 
		(1) the location and name of the mail program.
		(2) your email address.
	Once those are done, it is ready to upload.


STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:

NOTE: If you believe you are missing files or what you have is corrupted, go to 
http://www.willmaster.com/MasterWebpageMailer and download the latest complete version.

There are six (6) steps to a working installation of MasterWebpageMailer.

Before continuing, ensure that Perl 5+ is available on your system. If you don't know, 
your system administrator is the one to ask.

(1) Modify the MasterWebpageMailer.cgi program code:

The first line of the MasterWebpageMailer program code, all the way at the top, 
	must contain the location of Perl 5 on your system. The line begins with 
	"#!" (without the quotes) and ends with the location (no white space). 
	(Note: MasterWebpageMailer will not work with versions of Perl prior to 5.)

(2) Modify the globals.cgi file:

	(a) Modify the value of the variable MailProgram to reflect the location and 
  		name of your mail program. 

	(b) Modify the value of the variable ToAddy to reflect the email address where 
  		you want the forms results emailed to. For additional insurance from email 
	      harvesting, use an asterisk ("*") in your email address instead of the 
      	commecial at symbol ("@"). The program will then fix the address before use.

(3) Upload the MasterWebpageMailer.cgi and globals.cgi into a directory/folder 
	which is allowed to execute CGI programs. Be sure to upload the files 
	as ASCII text files rather than as binary files.

(4) Set the file permissions:
	CHMOD MasterWebpageMailer.cgi to 755.
	755 translates to "read/write/execute - read/execute - read/execute"
	If you don't have telnet access to your system, some FTP programs, 
	such as WS_FTP95 LE (possibly available at www.tucows.com), allow 
	changing file and directory permissions. (With WS_FTP95 LE, select 
	a file or directory; right-click; select "chmod UNIX"; check 
	owner/read, owner/write, owner/execute, group/read, group/execute, 
	other/read, and other/execute; and click "OK".)

(5) Create the form to be used with MasterWebpageMailer. It is suggested that the 
    form be on the web page whose contents are to be emailed.

	In the following instructions, an example form with all fields present, 
	heavily commented, is used. The form is presented, one section at a time, 
	and then presented in its entirety at the end.

	All fields are required.

<form method="POST" action="http://www.willmaster.com/cgi-bin/MasterWebpageMailer.cgi">

	The form's method can be either POST or GET (all capital letters). 

	The form's action is the URL of the MasterWebpageMailer program code on your 
	system. Replace "http://www.willmaster.com/cgi-bin/MasterWebpageMailer.cgi" 
	with the correct URL.

<input type="hidden" name="path" value="/usr/local/htdocs/MasterWebpageMailer/index.html">

	This is the only hidden fields. The value of this hidden field, path, is the 
	server location and name of the web page file whose contents are to be emailed.

	(Note: This is the location and name of the file on your server, not the URL.)

<input type=hidden name="redirect" value="http://www.willmaster.com/MasterWebpageMailer/thankyou.html">

	The value of this hidden field, redirect, is the URL where the visitor's browser 
  	will be redirected to after they successfully submit feedback to you. If you do 
	not provide this URL, the program will try to bring the visitor back to the page 
	where the form is located.

<input type="text" name="fromemail">

	This is the field where your visitors type in their email address. The email 
	with your web page contents will have this email address in the "From:" line.

<input type="text" name="name">

	This is the field where your visitors type in their name.

<input type="text" name="toemail">

	This is the field where your visitors type where the email with your web page 
	contents will be sent to.

<input type=submit value="Mail This Page!"></font></td>

	This is what your visitor clicks on after the fields have been filled in. You 
	may change the value to whatever you want the button to say.

</form>

	This is the end of the form.

	Below is the same form, presented in its entirety (with some additional formatting):

<form method="POST" action="http://www.willmaster.com/cgi-bin/MasterWebpageMailer.cgi">
<input type="hidden" name="path" value="/usr/local/htdocs/MasterWebpageMailer/index.html">
<input type=hidden name="redirect" value="http://www.willmaster.com/MasterWebpageMailer/thankyou.html">
FROM email: <input type="text" name="fromemail">
<br>
Your name: <input type="text" name="name">
<br>
TO email: <input type="text" name="toemail">
<br>
<input type=submit value="Mail This Page!"></font></td>
</form>

	Insert the form into your web page.

(6) Mark the text of your web page which is to be emailed on demand.

	You decide which portions of your page is to be emailed. You may email invisible 
	portions, too (not visible in the browser).

	As you progress through this section, you can use the MasterWebpageMailer download 
	page as an example. You may save the source code to your computer for reference. 
	It is at http://www.willmaster.com/MasterWebpageMailer/index.html 

	The program will only email what you tell it to.

	To begin an emailing portion,use the code:

BEGIN MasterWebpageMailer 

	To end an emailing portion, use the code:

END MasterWebpageMailer 

	You can have many different portions of content for emailing. Just use the begin and 
	end codes to tell the program what to do.

	The program never prints any line which contains either of the above begin or end codes.

	The program prints everything between the begin and end codes, including line breaks, 
	EXCEPT it strips out all HTML tags.

	Usually, you don't want the begin and end codes to be visible in your browser web 
	page. The codes can be put into HTML comment areas to hide them.

	Here is how the codes are used:

	This first example prints both in the browser and in the email.

<!-- BEGIN MasterWebpageMailer -->
This text shows up in the browser.
It is also marked for emailing.
<!-- END MasterWebpageMailer -->

	The second example prints only in the email. Notice that the whole thing is within
	one comment area.

<!-- BEGIN MasterWebpageMailer
This text goes out in the email
but does not show in the browser.
END MasterWebpageMailer -->

	That's the basics.

	In preparing your page, the first step is to decide how you want your email 
	to look. Here is an example:

The web page from where this was sent is at 
http://www.domain.com/index.html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The breakdown of the coffee bean began during a harvest.
A worker accidentally stepped on a bean and crushed it. On 
impulse, the worker dropped the crushed bean into a cup of
water.

Now, the sun has been shining on that cup of water for some 
time. The water was hot.

When the worker sipped the result, "coffee" was born. And 
it was the beginning of demand for broken coffee beans.

Cost of BuckStore Coffee (hot):

Size               Price

 8 oz.             $ .69
12 oz.             $4.79
48 oz.             $ .29

As you can see, since the original crush nothing makes 
sense any more.

	Okay, let's suppose that only the center portion, between the "~~~ ..." lines, is
	to be displayed on the browser's web page.

	Here is the complete HTML page which will display what you want in the browser and
	also email, properly formatted, what you want emailed. (Of course, the CGI program 
	must be installed, and the form's action="________" and "path" must be corrected.)
