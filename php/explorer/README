This is the readme file for the File Explorer v1.3 Project

-----------
Important :
-----------

This web file explorer takes for root directory the directory
defined in the pathfile path.ini.

Tailor the variable $ROOTURL to the URL of the directory you want
to be the root directory of (i.e. the base browsed by) the explorer.
Then, tailor the variable $ROOPATH to the physical full path 
represented by $ROOTURL.

A dynamic example using environment variable is currently given in path.ini
but feel free to change this settings by static settings.

********
Example
********

For example, your web site is installed under /var/www/mysite,
and the URL of this site is http://www.mysite.com
Your explorer is installed under /var/www/mybackoffice, and the URL of the back-office
is http://www.mybackoffice.com.

Say you want to set the root directory of the explorer to http://www.mysite.com,
then write those two line instead of the existing definitions in path.ini:

	$ROOTURL="http://www.mysite.com";
	$ROOTPATH="/var/www/mysite";

Later, you will browse your site at the URL http://www.mybackoffice.com/explorer

***********
Preferences
***********

Tailor the file explorer.cfg to your own preferences:

$IsSim: 0 or 1,
	0 for real mode, allow file writing, mkdir and rmdir
	1 for simulation, file writing is disable in this mode.

$IsShowDelete: 0 or 1
	0 to hide the Delete button in the explorer
	1 to display the Delete button.
