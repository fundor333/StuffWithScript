Installation Instructions:

These instructions are basic.  Please check http://www.customprogramming.net/
for more complete instructions.

First, move the 'uas' directory into your cgi-bin.
IMPORTANT: Protect the uas directory!!  Put a htaccess file in there!
Next, move the 'images' directory into somewhere accessable from the outside
	world
Now edit lib.config.pl in the uas directory.  Point the config to the
	correct SQL details.  SQL is not required for the UAS, but ALL
	modules for the UAS require SQL.  If you don't have a SQL database
	ask your system administrator for one.  The UAS uses mysql currently
	but should work with other servers with only a few changes.

	If you would simply prefer to change web hosts, we recommend
	http://www.hypa.net/ (or check customprogramming.net for a list
	of compatible ISPs which provide SQL access.
Chmod the file 'home' to 755.
Point your browser to http://yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/admin/home

If your web server requires the .cgi extension, then rename the home file.
