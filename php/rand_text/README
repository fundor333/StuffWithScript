Random Text is a program which takes a plain text file, which contains a 
series of phrases, quotes, lines of text, etc... and a delimiter (the 
character(s) which separate each entry) and will randomly choose one of the
phrases and display it on your web page.  This requires the use of Server
Side Includes, which you can read more about at the FAQ URL listed above.

There are two files included with this script:
        1) README       - This file; includes detailed installation 
		          instructions.
        2) rand_text.pl - The Perl script which generates the random phrase
                          and siaplys it on your web page.

The rand_text.pl file has two variables which must be modified.  You then 
must place this file in a special executable directory (usually called 
cgi-bin) or rename it to end with a .cgi extension if your server is set up 
that way.

RAND_TEXT.PL -

    There are two variables in this program which must be modified:

	$random_file = "/path/to/random.txt";
		This variable points to the location of the file which 
		contains the phrases which you wish to have randomly 
		displayed.  This shoul dbe a system path and not a URL.

	$delimiter = "\n\%\%\n";
		This specifies what separates each record.  If you leave it
		as the default, your $random_file database should look like:

	   -----------begin sample random database file--------------
           Phrase one would go here.
		As much white space or formatting as you want.
  	   %%
	   Second Phrase would go here.
	   %%
	   And the next
	     Second line of the next.
	   %%
	   Etc...
	   -----------end sample random database file----------------

		If you set $delimiter = "\n";, then the script would assume
		that every line is a separate phrase and randomize the 
		file based on that.

		How to Implement This In Your Web Pages.

This script must be called as a Server Side Include, or it can also be called
on a page by itself (however that is not as nice looking.)  Below are some 
examples of how to call this program:

    <!--#exec cgi="/url/path/to/rand_text.cgi"-->

That woudl simply call the program from a Server Side Include and the Random 
Text woud appear in that location on your web page.

HISTORY

   Version 1.0  - 7/13/95       - First Version Released

##############################################################################

Have fun with this script, but if you can, please follow these rules:

1) If you implement it on a page, please let me know the URL of where it is 
   implemented so I can see my work

and

2) Please keep my name and url in the script itself somewhere, and if you 
would like you could even add it to your page, but that is not necessary.

If you have any questions, let me know and I will try and help!
